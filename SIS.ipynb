    "## Overall process of DER impact study\n",
    "Once a proposal of DER received from applicant, following processor is done.\n",
    "1. Data Collection: \n",
    "  - DER parameters: rated power, inverter characteristics, protection settings, fault current contribution, control modes (Volt/VAR, frequency droop, etc.).\n",
    "  -  Grid data: feeder topology, transformer details, line impedances, load data, existing DER penetration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. System Modeling:\n",
    "  - Simulations tools: PSSÂ®E, CYME, DIgSILENT PowerFactory, OpenDSS, PSCAD.\n",
    "  - Source modeling is done by using impedance value and is connected to dedicated BUS KV.\n",
    "  - Likewise, regulators, reclosers of appropriate ratings are modelled\n",
    "\n",
    "For references: \n",

    "  <em>Fig. 1: SLD</em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Load Allocation: is done for realistic load flow modeling\n",
    " - Meter data is mapped to feeder buses and loads are divided based on kVA demand and distributed across connected nodes.\n",
    " - Both on and off- peak data is selected for the worst case scenarios.Outliers should be avoided for analysis.\n",
    " - If there are already existing projects, that should also be considered while allocating the Load data. \n",
    " - Before running, check all the modeling, operating voltages and scenarios are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Project Modeling\n",
    " - Respective DER (solar, wind, etc) with respective size or power rating should be modelled.\n",
    " - If it is connected through riser, it should also be modelled properly as \"Under Ground\"\n",
    " - Inverter, Grounding transformer, GSU transformer, Capacitor bank etc should also be modelled.\n",

But as shown in below equation, for the same KVA, the action of abosorbtion become limited as active power reduced in a bigger amount\n",

    "Following mitigations methods are used for mitigations of Overvoltage:\n",
    "1. Reconductoring \n",
    "   - Upgrading conductor to higher sizes immediately results out the lower voltages at Point of Common Coupling but this is the expensive way of mitigating the Overvoltage.\n",
    "   - This method also helps with voltage flicker.\n",
    "   - When we proposed a better conductor, impedances reduces resulting flatter voltage profile.\n",
    "   - It is mainly done to: \n",
    "       - Increase current-carrying capacity\n",
    "       - Reduce line losses\n",
    "       - Improve voltage regulation\n",
    "       - Enhance reliability and safety\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Examples: ACSR (Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced), AAAC (All Aluminum Alloy Conductor), HTLS (High-Temperature Low-Sag)\n",

    " 2. Non-Unity Leading Operation of Inverters along with switchable capacitor banks\n",
    "   - Inverters are set to consume reactive power (Vars) from the grid called leading power factor operation\n",
    "   - Since inverters are drawing reactive power, the grid might need extra reactive support to stay balanced.\n",
    "   - So we install capacitor banks either at the substation or on nearby poles to inject reactive power back into the system when needed\n",
    "   \n",
    " 3. Volt-Var Control\n",
    "   - Volt/VAR Control is a dynamic strategy that uses reactive power devices to keep voltage within safe limits,especially when there is high generation from solar/wind.\n",

    "  </p>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Here, \n",
    "   - P1 at V1: Voltage is low, so the inverter provides maximum capacitive VARs (Q1) to help boost voltage.\n",
    "   - P2 at V2: Voltage has increased slightly, so the inverter provides less capacitive support.\n",
    "   - P3 at V3: Voltage is near nominal, so the inverter provides zero VARs neutral operation.\n",
    "   - P4 at V4: Voltage is high, so the inverter starts absorbing inductive VARs (Q4) to help bring voltage down.\n",

    "  - CB 1 and CB 2 have curves that trip slower for the same fault level.\n",
